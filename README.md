Because of the slow internet where I live, I do not use any cloud computing or storage. I want to keep fairly up to date backups of the important data on my computer, so I use an external hard drive. The problem comes what it is time to back up all the files. I would have to manually find and copy each file, which is time consuming. So, I wrote this program that does all the heavy lifting for me. All I have to do now is connect my hard drive and run this program, and the files are backed up for me.
V3 changes - Added the ability to add more excluded files and directories from files within the directories to back up. To implement, copy exclude.txt into the directory that contains the files or directories that you want to exclude. List the path relative to the directory that exclude.txt is in. Leave the first line how it is.
