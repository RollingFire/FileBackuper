Because of the slow internet where I live, I do not use any cloud computing or storage. I want to keep fairly up to date backups of the important data on my computer, so I use an external hard drive. The problem comes what it is time to back up all the files. I would have to manually find and copy each file, which is time consuming. So, I wrote this program that does all the heavy lifting for me. All I have to do now is connect my hard drive and run this program, and the files are backed up for me.
